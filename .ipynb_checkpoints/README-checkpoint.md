The app contains an executive dashbaord to give the high level summary of the cryptocurrency. This summary will contain the weekly performance like average market cap, some cryptocurrencies.

We will also include a exchange rate table with 5 popular currency (CAD, INR, YEN, CNY, USD) so that people wish to transact with so that if an individual is interested in a particular cryptocurrency, he/she/they should know how much to dig in their pockets. 


#### KPI:  Rolling Average
Prices often move up and down by themselves due to external factors such as seasonality, major events, and factors that we cannot control
To remove this unwanted noise and gain a real grasp of data, we used aÂ rolling average
Rolling averages help us focus on the long-term impact of prices/volumes without losing sight of the short-term changes
